The second repository is called deliverable 2. It contains four .png files that depict four separate plots created in the part2marsweather.py file. The four plots are called: avg_low_temp_by_month.png, avg_pressure_by_month.png, daily_min_temp_by_elapsed_sol.png and sorted_avg_low_temp_by_month.png.

The second repository also contains the mars_weather.csv which depicts the data frame created within the part2marsweather.py file.

The second repository also contains the mars_weather.txt file which houses all of the outputs required for deliverable 2 including: the data types of the dataframe, the months table, the sols output, the average low temperature by month table and the average pressure by month table.
